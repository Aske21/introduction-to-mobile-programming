# The Application 
For our mobile application we are going to create a food recipe application. This 
application will offer you food recipes based on the ingredients you enter in the application. In 
addition to this feature, the user can browse recipes on the application. 
The user can also upload their own recipes on the application either for 
private viewing, so that they can use it as a cook book, or they can publish their recipes to other 
users on the application. The application will be called “Foody”
